Hi, my name is Farouk! I am a first year PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in the CS theory group. I enjoy thinking about recreational math and combinatorial optimization problems. In my free time, I enjoy creating [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqTBrQYYUcc&ab_channel=ForAllEpsilon) videos about problem solving. Prior to joining UIUC, I worked at Citadel as a Quantitative Trader in the index arbitrage team. In Summer 2022, I will be interining at Google in the NYC office.
