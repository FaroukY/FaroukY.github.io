Hi, my name is Farouk! I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in the [CS theory group](https://publish.illinois.edu/theory-cs/faculty/). I am lucky to be co-advised by [Sariel Har-Peled](https://sarielhp.org/) and [Chandra Chekuri](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/). My research interests span computational geometry, optimal stopping theory, scalable graph theory, and coding theory, with a focus on mixing theoretical insights with practical scalable algorithmic solutions. 

I did my undergrad in The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology where I was fortunate to work with [Mordecai Golin](https://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/golin/) and [Raymond Chi-Wing Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/). 

Prior to joining UIUC, I worked at Citadel as a Quantitative Trader for 2 years. In Summer 2022, I interned at Google. In Summer 2025, I interned at Two Sigma as a Quantitative Researcher.

## Misc.

- In my free time (which recently has been rare), I enjoy creating [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqTBrQYYUcc&ab_channel=ForAllEpsilon) videos about problem solving.
- I enjoy playing Chess and Poker.
- My endlessly supportive [wife](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-lam-hslhk/).
- Iâ€™m originally from Egypt. Please donâ€™t make assumptions about my political views or religious beliefs based on that. If youâ€™re genuinely curious about my perspective on something, just ask. Iâ€™ve added this note because itâ€™s been an issue more often than Iâ€™d expect.
